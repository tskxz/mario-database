 The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. Note that all commands need a semi-colon at the end. Create a new database named first_database.

> CREATE DATABASE first_database;

Your new database is there. If you don't get a message after entering a command, it means it's incomplete and you likely forgot the semi-colon. You can just add it on the next line and press enter to finish the command. Create another database named second_database.

> CREATE DATABASE second_database;
