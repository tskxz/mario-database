 The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. Note that all commands need a semi-colon at the end. Create a new database named first_database.

> CREATE DATABASE first_database;

Your new database is there. If you don't get a message after entering a command, it means it's incomplete and you likely forgot the semi-colon. You can just add it on the next line and press enter to finish the command. Create another database named second_database.

> CREATE DATABASE second_database;

You can connect to a database by entering \c database_name. You need to connect to add information. Connect to your second_database.

> \c second_database

Looks like there's no tables or relations yet. Similar to how you created a database, you can create a table like this:
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name();
```
Note that the parenthesis are needed for this one. It will create the table in the database you are connected to. Create a table named first_table in second_database.

> CREATE TABLE first_table();

Create another new table in this database. Give it a name of second_table.

> CREATE TABLE second_table();

You can view more details about a table by adding the table name after the display command like this: `\d table_name`. View more details about your second_table.

> \d second_table

Tables need columns to describe the data in them, yours doesn't have any yet. Here's an example of how to add one:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;
```
Add a column to second_table named first_column. Give it a data type of INT. INT stands for integer. Don't forget the semi-colon. ðŸ˜„

> ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN first_column INT;

Use ALTER TABLE and ADD COLUMN to add another column to second_table named id that's a type of INT.

> ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN id INT;

Add another column to second_table named age. Give it a data type of INT.
> ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN age INT;


Those are some good looking columns. You will probably need to know how to remove them. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```
Drop your age column.
> ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN age;

Use the ALTER TABLE and DROP COLUMN keywords again to drop first_column.
> ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN first_column;


A common data type is VARCHAR. It's a short string of characters. You need to give it a maximum length when using it like this: `VARCHAR(30).`

Add a new column to `second_table`, give it a name of name and a data type of `VARCHAR(30)`.

> ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN name VARCHAR(30);

The 30 means the data in it can be a max of 30 characters. You named that column name, it should have been username. Here's how you can rename a column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;
```
Rename the name column to username.

> ALTER TABLE second_table RENAME COLUMN name TO username;

Rows are the actual data in the table. You can add one like this:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);
```
Insert a row into second_table. Give it an id of 1, and a username of Samus. The username column expects a `VARCHAR`, so you need to put Samus in single quotes like this: `'Samus'`.
> INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES (1, 'Samus');


You should have one row in your table. You can view the data in a table by querying it with the SELECT statement. Here's how it looks:
```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_name;
```
Use a SELECT statement to view all the columns in second_table. Use an asterisk (*) to denote that you want to see all the columns.

> SELECT * FROM second_table;

There's your one row. Insert another row into second_table. Fill in the id and username columns with the values 2 and 'Mario'.

> INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES (2, 'Mario');

Insert another row into second_table. Use 3 as the id, and Luigi as the username this time.

> INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES (3, 'Luigi');


That gives me an idea ðŸ˜ƒ You can make a database of Mario video game characters. You should start from scratch for it. Why don't you delete the record you just entered. Here's an example of how to delete a row:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
Remove Luigi from your table. The condition you want to use is username='Luigi'.

> DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Luigi';

It's gone. You can scrap all this for the new database. Delete Mario from second_table using the same command as before, except make the condition username='Mario' this time.

> DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Mario';
Only one more row should remain. Delete Samus from second_table.

> DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Samus';

There's two columns. You won't need either of them for the Mario database. Alter the table second_table and drop the column `username`.
> ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN username;

Next, drop the id column.
> ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN id;

Still two. You won't need either of those for the new database either. Drop second_table from your database. Here's an example:
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
> DROP TABLE second_table;

Next, drop first_table from the database.
> DROP TABLE first_table;

Rename first_database to mario_database. You can rename a database like this:
```sql
ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;
```
> ALTER DATABASE first_database RENAME TO mario_database;

Now that you aren't connected to second_database, you can drop it. Use the `DROP DATABASE` keywords to do that.

> DROP DATABASE second_database;

Create a new table named characters, it will hold some basic information about Mario characters.

> CREATE TABLE characters();

Next, you can add some columns to the table. Add a column named character_id to your new table that is a type of SERIAL.
> ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN character_id SERIAL;

The SERIAL type will make your column an INT with a NOT NULL constraint, and automatically increment the integer when a new row is added. View the details of the characters table to see what SERIAL did for you.
> /d characters

Add a column to characters called name. Give it a data type of VARCHAR(30), and a constraint of `NOT NULL`. Add a constraint by putting it right after the data type.
> ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL;

You can make another column for where they are from. Add another column named homeland. Give it a data type of VARCHAR that has a max length of 60.
> ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN homeland VARCHAR(60);


Video game characters are quite colorful. Add one more column named favorite_color. Make it a VARCHAR with a max length of 30.
> ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN favorite_color VARCHAR(30);

You are ready to start adding some rows. First is Mario. Earlier, you used this command to add a row:
```sql
INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(1, 'Samus');
```

The first parenthesis is for the column names, you can put as many columns as you want. The second parenthesis is for the values for those columns. Add a row to your table, give it a `name` of `Mario`, a `homeland` of `Mushroom Kingdom`, and a `favorite_color` of `Red`. Make sure to use single quotes where needed.

> INSERT INTO characters(character_id, name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES (1, 'Mario', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red');

Add another row for Luigi. Give it a name of Luigi, a homeland of Mushroom Kingdom, and a favorite_color of Green.
> INSERT INTO characters(character_id, name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES (2, 'Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green');

Add another row for Peach. Give her the values: Peach, Mushroom Kingdom, and Pink.
> INSERT INTO characters(character_id, name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES (3, 'Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');

Adding rows one at a time is quite tedious. Here's an example of how you could have added the previous three rows at once:
```sql
INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color)
VALUES('Mario', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'),
('Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green'),
('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');
```
Add two more rows. Give the first one the values: Toadstool, Mushroom Kingdom, and Red. Give the second one: Bowser, Mushroom Kingdom, and Green. Try to add them with one command.
> INSERT INTO characters(character_id, name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES (4, 'Toadstool', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'), (5, 'Bowser', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green');

If you don't get a message after a command, it is likely incomplete. This is because you can put a command on multiple lines. Add two more rows. Give the first one the values: Daisy, Sarasaland, and Yellow. The second: Yoshi, Dinosaur Land, and Green. Try to do it with one command.
> INSERT INTO characters(character_id, name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES (5, 'Daisy', 'Sarasaland', 'Yellow'), (6, 'Yoshi', 'Dinosaur Land', 'Green');

It looks good, but there's a few mistakes. You can change a value like this:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;
```
You used username='Samus' as a condition earlier. SET Daisy's favorite_color to Orange. You can use the condition name='Daisy' to change her row.

> UPDATE characters SET favorite_color='Orange' WHERE name='Daisy';

Toadstool's name is wrong as well, it's actually Toad. Use UPDATE to SET his name to Toad. Use the condition favorite_color='Red'.
> UPDATE characters SET name='Toad' WHERE favorite_color='Red';

Using favorite_color='Red' was not a good idea. Mario's name changed to Toad because he likes red, and now there's two rows that are the same. Well, almost. Only the character_id is different. You will have to use that to change it back to Mario. Use UPDATE to set the name to Mario for the row with the lowest character_id
> UPDATE characters SET name='Mario' WHERE character_id = 1;

Toad's favorite color is wrong. He likes blue. Change Toad's favorite color to Blue. Use whatever condition you want, but don't change any of the other rows.
> UPDATE characters SET favorite_color='Blue' WHERE name='Toad';

Bowser's favorite_color is wrong. He likes Yellow. Why don't you update it without changing any of the other rows?
> UPDATE characters SET favorite_color='Yellow' WHERE name='Bowser';

Bowser's homeland is wrong as well. He's from the Koopa Kingdom. Why don't you change it to that without changing any other rows?
> UPDATE characters SET homeland='Koopa Kingdom' WHERE name='Bowser';


View all the data, but put it in order by character_id.
```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
```

> SELECT * FROM characters ORDER BY character_id;

It looks good. Next, you are going to add a primary key. It's a column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Here's an example of how to set a PRIMARY KEY:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);
```
The name column is pretty unique, why don't you set that as the primary key for this table.

> ALTER TABLE characters ADD PRIMARY KEY(name);

You can see the key for your name column at the bottom. It would have been better to use character_id for the primary key. Here's an example of how to drop a constraint:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```
Drop the primary key on the name column. You can see the constraint name is characters_pkey.
ALTER TABLE characters DROP CONSTRAINT characters_pkey;

It's gone. Set the primary key again, but use the character_id column this time.
> ALTER TABLE characters ADD PRIMARY KEY(character_id);

The table looks complete for now. Next, create a new table named more_info for some extra info about the characters.
> CREATE TABLE more_info();

Add a column to your new table named more_info_id. Make it a type of SERIAL.
> ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN more_info_id SERIAL;

Set your new column as the primary key for this table.
> ALTER TABLE more_info ADD PRIMARY KEY(more_info_id);

Add another column to more_info named birthday. Give it a data type of DATE.
> ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN birthday DATE;

Add a height column to more_info that's a type of INT.
> ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN height INT;

Add a weight column. Give it a type of NUMERIC(4, 1). That data type is for decimals. NUMERIC(4, 1) has up to four digits and one of them has to be to the right of the decimal.
> ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN weight NUMERIC(4,1);

Thereâ€™s your four columns and the primary key you created at the bottom. To know what row is for a character, you need to set a foreign key so you can relate rows from this table to rows from your characters table. Here's an example that creates a column as a foreign key:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);
```
That's quite the command. In the more_info table, create a character_id column. Make it an INT and a foreign key that references the character_id column from the characters table. Good luck.

> ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN character_id INT REFERENCES characters(character_id);

There's your foreign key at the bottom. These tables have a "one-to-one" relationship. One row in the characters table will be related to exactly one row in more_info and vice versa. Enforce that by adding the UNIQUE constraint to your foreign key. Here's an example:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE(column_name);
```
Add the UNIQUE constraint to the column you just added.

> ALTER TABLE more_info ADD UNIQUE(character_id);

The column should also be NOT NULL since you don't want to have a row that is for nobody. Here's an example:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;
```
Add the NOT NULL constraint to your foreign key column.

ALTER TABLE more_info ALTER COLUMN character_id SET NOT NULL;
