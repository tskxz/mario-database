 The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. Note that all commands need a semi-colon at the end. Create a new database named first_database.
